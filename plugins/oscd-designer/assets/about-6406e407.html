<p>The editor is based around a drag-and-drop palette.</p>
<p>It is designed to stay as close as possible to the requirements of IEC 61850-6, but uses its own namespace, <code>esld</code> for storing coordinates, orientation, connectivity information (within a <code>Private</code> element) and identifying transformer types.</p>
<p>It allows drawing of multiple Substations and this can be used together with other plugins to add logical nodes and enhanced functionality.</p>
<p>When drawing an SLD, keep the following modelling requirements in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voltage Levels are generally the first item which must be drawn</li>
<li>Bays must be within Voltage Levels</li>
<li>Transformers can be placed within Substations, Voltage Levels or Bays (within the SCL file, this is based on their center of rotation)</li>
<li>Primary system busbars are modelled as a Bay with a single Connectivity Node</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a restriction in the SCL schema which means a Substation without a Voltage Level or a Voltage Level a Bay is not valid -- this means there is often a schema error noticed after initialising a Substation or placing a Voltage Level.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>During any action, pressing Esc on the keyboard will cancel it, as will clicking the cross button on the palette.</p>
<h3>Placing</h3>
<p>After clicking on the palette, items can be placed.
While placing, a middle click will rotate the item and also its label text for placement.</p>
<h3>Earthing</h3>
<p>To earth a terminal, right-click on it.</p>
<h3>Rotating and Mirroring</h3>
<p>To rotate an item, middle-click on it.</p>
<p>To mirror, right-click and select the &quot;Mirror&quot; option.
Mirroring only works in the vertical dimension and to avoid confusion should be done before rotating a symbol.</p>
<h3>Connecting</h3>
<p>Conducting Equipment connects via Terminal elements which are created when a connection is made (the <code>pathName</code> is shown on hover) to an orange connection point.
Neutral Points for Power Transformer are the blue-green connection points.</p>
<p>Connections are made by clicking on conducting equipment and then clicking for each &quot;stop&quot; in an orthogonal path.
Connections for Power Transformers must be made from the Power Transformer to the Conducting Equipment.</p>
<p>Generally it is best to connect the main &quot;power flow&quot; path first and then connect single terminal items (earthing switches, Voltage Transformers) subsequently otherwise it is possible to not have any orange terminals left to connect to.</p>
<p>When clicking on an item, valid connection points are shown with an orange triangle.
In the initial implementation, Power Transformers cannot be directly connected to Power Transformers (as ).</p>
<h3>Moving</h3>
<p>When moving an item, its connections are removed and reconnection is required. Sometimes this can affect a large number of connections (especially on Busbars).
It can be helpful to use undo (Ctrl+Z) and redo (Ctrl+Y) to see these connections.</p>
<p>Labels can be moved by left-clicking on them.</p>
<p>Immediately adjacent items can be connected by clicking on the orange circle and then the orange triangle.</p>
<h3>Copying</h3>
<p>A copy made is available on the context menu and can also be achieved by &quot;shift-clicking&quot; inside a Voltage Level, Bay or on a Conducting Equipment item after which the copy can be placed.</p>
<p>It can be useful to &quot;window scroll&quot; while using a mouse scroll button which defaults to vertical scrolling can be restricted to horizontal scrolling by holding down the Shift on the keyboard.</p>
<p>Currently copying of Voltage Levels and Bays results in the removal of any connectivity where that connectivity reaches outside of the Voltage Level or Bay.</p>
<h3>Deleting</h3>
<p>When an item is deleted, any unnecessary Connectivity Nodes are removed.
When necessary, Connectivity Nodes are allocated to new bays &quot;on the fly&quot;.</p>
<h2>Context Menus</h2>
<p>Most features are also available by right-clicking on an item or its label which brings up a context menu.
Directly opening the SCL wizard for the specific element can be done by middle-clicking on the item.
This is especially useful for renaming items quickly.
For Tap Changers, this must be done by using the context menu, &quot;Edit Tap Changer&quot; option.</p>
<h2>Other Features</h2>
<p>A &quot;Hide Labels&quot; toggle button on the palette (adjacent to the zoom in and zoom out) is available to turn labels on and off to allow display of only the SLD symbols.</p>
<h3>SVG Export</h3>
<p>A &quot;Download&quot; button is available for an SVG 1.1 export which can be readily used in other software. Bay and voltage levels lines are removed in this view.</p>
<p>If desirable, the &quot;Hide Labels&quot; button can be toggled prior to using this.</p>
<h3>Transformers</h3>
<p>The tool currently supports a subset of possible transformers:</p>
<ul>
<li>earthing transformers with one or two windings</li>
<li>auto-transformers with or without a tertiary</li>
<li>two and three winding transformers</li>
</ul>
<p>Only one winding may have a Load Tap Changer.</p>
<h2>Issues and Opportunities</h2>
<p>Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/OMICRONEnergy/oscd-designer/issues">file an issue</a> if you would like to see a feature developed or discuss a problem that you&#39;ve identified.</p>
<p>Current limitations which impact on usability are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power Transformers cannot be connected directly to other Power Transformers</li>
<li>Resizing or moving of busbars results in a loss of other Conducting Equipment connections</li>
<li>Copying of Voltage Levels and Bays results in a loss of connections of the same Connectivity Node</li>
<li>Only 3 phase functionality is provided (no single phase modelling)</li>
</ul>
